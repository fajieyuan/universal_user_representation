papers of universal user representations learning for recommendation

# Our research papers that apply pre-training and transfer learning to learn universal user representations:

1 Parameter-Efficient Transfer from Sequential Behaviors for User Modeling and Recommendation SIGIR2020 https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04253 With github codes and datasets.

Keywords: self-supervise learning, user sequential behaviors, pretraining, transfer learning, user representation, user profile prediction, cold-start problem

(1) We are the first to evidence that self-supervised user behavior pre-training helps many downstream tasks.

(2) We are also the first to provide user profile prediction as a way to show the universal property of user representation

(3) We release a large-scale public dataset for user representation transer learning and source code.

2 One Person, One Model, One World: Learning Continual User Representation without Forgetting SIGIR2021 https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13724 With github codes and datasets.

Keywords: self-supervise learning, lifelong learning, pretraining, transfer learning, finetuning, user representation, user profile prediction, cold-start problem

(1) We are the first to propose universal lifelong user representation learning mechanism for recommender system

(2) We are the first to clearly demonstrate the catastrophic forgetting and over-parameterization issues in recommender sytem.

(3) We release the dataset for lifelong user representation learning and source code.
